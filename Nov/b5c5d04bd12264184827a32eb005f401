Celebrate the end of 2019 on a fashionable high note at the 10th annual Franschhoek Cap Classique & Champagne Festival, ‘The Magic of Bubbles’. One of SA’s premier social calendar highlights, this is the perfect excuse to dress up in your most stylish outfit while sipping on some of the country’s finest Méthode Cap Classiques (MCC) and French champagnes. This year’s two-day event takes place over the weekend of 30 November and 1 December at the iconic Huguenot Monument. Mingle with friends and producers as you sample the wide range of local MCCs and select French champagnes on offer. The grand marquee – the place to be seen – will be oozing style, elegance and sophistication. Adding to the superb offering will be a selection of delectable delights, on offer from some of Franschhoek’s fine eateries. “We’re excited to be part of this luxury lifestyle event,” says Carl Roothman, CEO of Sanlam Private Wealth. “It provides us with an ideal platform to collaborate with fellow masters of their craft and create an exclusive experience for guests. Over the two days, the same characteristics that inspire and drive us to grow and preserve wealth – such as practice, patience, meticulous attention to detail and even the need to take calculated risks – will also be evident in the delectable MCCs, champagne, dishes and music on display.” Breaking from tradition and in celebration of the festival’s 10th anniversary, the organisers have decided to change things up a bit with this year’s dress code, which is Blue and White. Regal colours in their own right, the new theme allows festivalgoers the perfect excuse to indulge in some retail therapy beforehand to find that perfect outfit. As in previous years, a prize will be awarded to the Best Dressed Couple on each day. For more information visit www.webtickets.co.za

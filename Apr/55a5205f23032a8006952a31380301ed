Situated on Spier Wine farm,  Vadas Smokehouse & Bakery’s Burger Challenge is exclusively for those with big appetites. Starting Wednesday 24 April 2019 customers can attempt to eat a Farmer Angus 600g burger patty served on our Vadas Bakery burger bun, garnished with tomato, cheese and lettuce, accompanied by Vadas pork fat fried chips and a pint of beer. The challenge will take place every Wednesday for both lunch and dinner. There is no certain time allotted for the burger to be completed in.  However the person would need to book on the Tuesday for the kitchen to prep. The challenge will run for the month of May 2019. PLEASE NOTE: “This is something fun to offer our guests. Do not confuse ‘challenge’ with competition. Its more like an offer or special….(hence there is no prize).” Booking closes every Tuesday at 6pm for the following days challenge. R250 only at Vadas Smokehouse & Bakery on Spier Wine Farm 
Booking essential on 021 809 1137 or info@vadas.co.za

Darling Brew Woodstock opened their doors to the public on Saturday, 2 March 2019, bringing the extensive range of Darling Brew craft beers closer to craft beer lovers in Cape Town. Hailing from Germany, General Manager Lars Pflanz blends his successful recipe for operating bars and restaurants in Europe with a South African flavour to offer a truly unique dining experience featuring bratwurst and boerewors, German-style pretzels and gourmet burgers as well as traditional flammkuchen, exceptional cocktails and fine malt whiskies.  Beyond beer tasting and fantastic food, Darling Brew Woodstock will bring live music, open mic nights, brew classes, speed dating and so much more to the social scene in Cape Town giving locals a place to unwind after work, bond with mates or impress a date. Bringing the Darling Brew experience from the West Coast to Woodstock was an idea brewed between Darling Brew co-founders Kevin and Philippa Wood, and Verde Hotels’ owners Mario and Annemarie Delicio, with their shared values of environmental responsibility, sustainability and zero waste proving to be fertile ground.  Philippa Wood says, “ We are excited to bring the Darling experience from our home on the West Coast to Woodstock, one of Cape Town’s oldest and hippest suburbs – our range of beers is as diverse and eclectic as our new neighbourhood!” Darling Brew Woodstock will allow craft beer lovers to enjoy the entire Darling Brew range right in the heart of the Mother City at 85 Albert Road, Woodstock.

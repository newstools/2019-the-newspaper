Waterstone Village Shopping Centre in Somerset-West will be extended with a further 1132m² of retail and a raised parking deck above the existing parking area in front of the Virgin Active Gym building. The project started on 4 March and proposed completion date is September 2019. Access to the deck will be taken from two positions, firstly, from the existing slip lane from Main Road and, secondly, from within the existing parking area. The existing parking area will become a “semi-basement”, with the open parking deck above. This will effectively form a podium to the gym building. Additional parking will also be added at the back of the Shopping centre, against the Schonenberg wall. “By adding the deck and parking behind we will be able to provide an additional 150 parking bays which the Local authority insisted on.” Transport planning: Upgrades will be done to Main Road/R44 and the Main Road/Lobelia Street intersection to help with the flow of traffic. This project is intensive but well overdue. “We will have six months of interruptions but we are doing this to keep Waterstone Village the number one Centre in the Helderberg.” For more information visit www.waterstonevillage.co.za

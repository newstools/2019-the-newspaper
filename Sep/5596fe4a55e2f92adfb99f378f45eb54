To celebrate the onset of Spring, residents and visitors are invited to join in on the free guided walks and festivities to be held at various City Nature Reserves. ‘As residents we are blessed to be surrounded by so much natural beauty that we often overlook it. We live and work close to these beautiful nature reserves and conservation areas, but hardly make the time to experience them firsthand. I encourage residents and visitors to join in on these guided spring walks and for parents to use this as an opportunity to expose their children to a new experience in their neighbourhood. It’s time for locals and visitors to grab their hiking boots and camera, and to get out and up close with our breathtaking natural surroundings,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Spatial Planning and Environment, Alderman Marian Nieuwoudt. The list of upcoming events is as follows:  09:00 – 14:00   10:00 – 12:30     09:30 – 14:00  12:00 – 13:30   The Tygerberg Nature Reserve will also host a children’s spring holiday programme on 25 and 26 September 2019. Activities will start at 09:00 and end around 13:00 daily.

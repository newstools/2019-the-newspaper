No other country can celebrate their heritage with so must gusto than when South Africans from all walks of life come together for a good old braai. On 24th September, 2019 the festive fires will be lit when South Africans commemorate National Heritage Day aka Braai Day. Braai grills around the country will reflect the same diversity our country is blessed with and Benguela Cove Lagoon Wine Estate is promising exactly that! Being a Tuesday this year, the Benguela Cove family is inviting guests to join them for an early celebration at the estate on Saturday 21st. Chef Annie Badenhorst will be preparing generous and delicious sharing braai platters to evoke that special sense of togetherness. The platter serves four and includes a fire grilled Spatchcock Chicken, succulent beef short ribs, corn on the cob and a twist on the traditional braaibroodjie with toasted cheese and smoked tomato on ciabatta. This is complemented with a potato salad, a green salad and coleslaw. Annie added a good dollop of nostalgia when planning the dessert with a sweet ending that includes milk tart cheesecake, lemon koeksisters and gooseberry ice cream. Who can resist that? Whilst feasting on braai platters, guests can listen to live music, sip on beautiful estate wines, take in the views of the natural surrounds or have some fun with courtyard games. And don’t forget to take the kids for a round of Pirate Adventure Golf! Add a wine tasting, cellar tour or vineyard tour to your visit to learn about the cool climate wines and what makes them so unique. But don’t forget to book! This day is only a few braais away.

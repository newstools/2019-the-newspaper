Cape Town Air Access, together with the St Helena Government (SHG) and Airlink, welcomes a new connection between Cape Town and St Helena. The seasonal flight is scheduled weekly on a Tuesday and will operate from 3 December 2019 to 31 March 2020. Bookings are open until late February 2020. Helena Bennett, Director of Tourism for St Helena, said: “St Helena has for many years held a special connection with Cape Town which was once the port of call for the island’s Royal Mail Ship before it was decommissioned in February 2018. For the island to be once again connected with Cape Town provides our tourism industry with this much desired link. Being able to provide our visitors with the option of a two stop holiday where they can explore the magnificent Cape Town and then hop on a flight and spend a few days discovering the many treasures and beauty St Helena has to offer, will be a huge benefit to the island and our stakeholders.” The midweek Cape Town service supplements Airlink’s Saturday service to OR Tambo International Airport and will connect the Western Cape to the South Atlantic island during the peak season. With the opening of the award-winning St Helena airport in 2017, access to island has been made quicker and easier. St Helena, one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, has been called ‘the secret of the South Atlantic’. Visitors to the island can expect a destination rich in history, with attractions such as Napoleon’s residence, and encounter an Instagrammer’s paradise with volcanic coastlines, and view the highest number of whale sharks during its annual migration.

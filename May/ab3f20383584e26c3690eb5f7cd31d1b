Sealand, the Cape Town born, globally recognised brand of environmentally smart high-end bags, accessories and apparel, has launched a store in the new Dock Road Junction at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. Rooted in Cape Town where mountains and ocean vividly connect, the brand upcycles the structural properties and textures of waste material – specifically yacht sails, tents and advertising billboards and banners – into a new context, thus reducing the generation of waste and promoting sustainability. The new store now gives South Africans and international tourists direct access to a wide range of Sealand products, previously only available online or in high end international stores such as Selfridges, Matches Fashion and Mr Porter. Co-founder and business visionary, Mike Schlebach, says that the store is a natural progression of the brand’s growth into direct retail. “We have wanted a space to host events and express our educational voice for some time and we are excited that we have found the right bricks-and-mortar space to showcase Sealand’s full brand and lifestyle offering. We have a second retail store planned for Jozi, which will open during 2020. Over the next ten years, our vision is to see more Sealand stores strategically placed in different regions around the world.” Jasper Eales is Schlebach’s partner and the brains behind the brand’s designs: “My design philosophy is two-fold. First, reduce a design to its simplest functioning form where you remove rather than add, keeping in mind the principle that form follows function. Second, I try to incorporate environmentally responsible thinking with the ultimate goal being to tread lightly on this beautiful earth and to inspire others to do the same.”

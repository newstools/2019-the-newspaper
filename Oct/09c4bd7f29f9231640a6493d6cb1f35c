Cape Town City Ballet presents an exciting new trilogy of works with their Spring Season, Satori, which will be performed at the Artscape Opera House from 26 October – 9 November 2019. Satori encapsulates innovation and enlightenment with three inspiring works, two of which are being newly staged alongside an original commissioned work for Cape Town City Ballet by celebrated UK choreographer Kenneth Tindall. Tindall is one of Britain’s most exciting independent choreographers as well as being the Artistic Director of Digital and Choreographer in Residence at Northern Ballet. Following the wonderful response to Serenade in their Autumn Season, Cape Town City Ballet introduces a second George Balanchine work to the repertoire with his Concerto Barocco, performed to a score by Johann Sebastian Bach and this production to be staged by Diana White of the George Balanchine Trust. South African choreographer and South African dance treasure, Michelle Reid, stages a fully expanded new work of her creation Sheeple, her first production created on the Company.
Performed to music from a selection of modern composers, Sheeple is an arresting, swirling exploration of the power of the masses, and the pervasive inclination of society to blindly follow the pack. Reid is an award-winning seasoned and prolific choreographer who has a 30 year history of staging work in South Africa. Lighting Design for the spring season is by Wilhelm Disbergen. Satori is an athletic and breathtaking combination of classical and neo-classical ballet with an innovative twist; another superb tasting menu for the dance lover and aficionado. Tickets cost from R150 to R300. Tickets will be available via www.computicket.com or at any Shoprite Checkers outlet.

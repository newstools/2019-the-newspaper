The City of Cape Town is putting motorsport in the driving seat this November, with three events to rev the engines of motorsport enthusiasts. Following a forced pit stop due to inclement weather in September, Drift City has the green light to proceed this coming weekend, followed by the FIA World Rallycross on 9 and 10 November, and the International Music and Motor Festival on 23 and 24 November. “Cape Town has a long-standing motorsport culture and these events provide enthusiasts the opportunity to enjoy their favourite sport. By supporting these events, the City of Cape Town wants to play a role in introducing platforms for more responsible racing instead of illegal street racing which unfortunately remains very prevalent on our roads, often with devastating consequences.” “We also believe that these high octane motorsport events will contribute to further solidifying the city’s reputation as the world’s festival and events capital. We are looking forward to not only the action on the track but also to work with the event organisers to create all-round experiences for all the spectators. These events not only position Cape Town as Africa’s premier motorsport hub, but they also assist in stimulating the local economy by providing opportunities to driving talent and vendors,” said Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith. Drift City For the fourth year running, the Grand Parade will play host to Cape Town’s flagship motorsport festival on Sunday 3 November 2019.

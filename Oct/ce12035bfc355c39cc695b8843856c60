Once you think Benguela Cove Wine Estate has reached its full potential with a plethora of offerings including food, wine and art, it introduces another reason to visit the estate. Owner of Benguela Cove, Penny Streeter OBE, set out to merge food, wine and art on a collective platform to celebrate its importance in the South African wine and hospitality industry. “These art forms embrace the rich heritage, natural produce and talent in South Africa.
The terroir is celebrated through exceptional wine, local produce is honoured with delicious food and now the art of a master South African sculptor will also grace our premises.” The official launch on the 26th of October unveils all 40 pieces, led by the work called Oblivion of the Waves with a formal introduction by Smit and Streeter. Internationally revered for his sculptures that often includes monumental pieces like heads and masks, but his work also communicates something vulnerable and delicate, Smit explains. “Oblivion of the Waves will suit its new home at Benguela Cove, so close to the sea.
This work investigates the landscape of the soul, offering a fleeting glimpse of eternity.
The dimness of our reflection in the mirror of the universe leaves us gasping for immortality as we sink into the abyss of the self.” This exhibition is the first chapter of what is planned to become a world-renowned art and sculpture park at Benguela Cove’s sister property in the United Kingdom, Leonardslee Lakes & Gardens. “Looking at the vast spaces and the spectacle of colour, I could envision the grounds being graced powerful works of art,” Streeter explains the moment of realisation that made her reach out to Smit to discuss a collaboration and prospects of a sculpture park.
The works that will be on display at Benguela Cove will vary from pieces the size of a man’s first to some sculptures standing three metres tall. The art will be open for viewing seven days a week.

As with fine food and world-class wines, so too fine art needs to be experienced to be appreciated. Visitors to Franschhoek can once again look forward to a weekend of artworks and exhibitions, as the 4th annual Art Franschhoek ‘opens its doors’ to the public. To celebrate the start of this festival of art appreciation some of the participating galleries will be hosting special events during the weekend of 25-27 October 2019. Over the years Franschhoek has established itself as one of the country’s premier art destinations with its numerous art galleries and resident artists. Art enthusiasts can choose to leisurely browse the galleries situated along the village’s main road, and within comfortable walking distance from each other. Alternatively choose to view the artworks on display at some of the wine farms, which include Grande Provence and La Motte. Garden and art tours at Leeu Estate add an extra touch to your cultural outing. Art Franschchoek celebrates these artists, and allows visitors to experience this unique part of Franschhoek.

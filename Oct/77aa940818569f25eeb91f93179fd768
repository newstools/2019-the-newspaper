KAMERS/Makers’ first half of 2019 has been nothing short of amazing, with thousands of handpicked, handmade South African products being showcased at their autumn shows in Cape Town and Joburg. These two shows launched over 70 brand new Makers – many of whom reported record sales, so a heartfelt thank to the SA public who continue to boost the artisan SME economy. Since 2003 the Boland ‘up’-market has been a highlight on the calendars of many decor, design and craft lovers. Expect nothing less from 29 October – 3 November 2019 as KAMERS/Makers return to the scenic Blaauwklippen Vineyards, which in 2018 proved to be one of the best-loved venues yet. With more than 190 handpicked Makers it will be the biggest Boland show yet! KAMERS/Makers will close off the year with the ever-popular Irene event at Cornwall Hill College in Pretoria. Each of these shows sees 170 or more of SA’s most creative Makers showcasing everything from handcrafted decor and fashion to artisan food and wine. As always, expect a proudly South African celebration of true artisan craft, design, and so much more… a truly inspiring experience. “Our partnership with Consol Glass is proving to be a perfect match and we have, to date, taken a staggering 100,000 plastic bottles out of circulation through the hugely popular Curvy glass bottle giveaways. Together we are removing the need for single-use plastic bottles at all our shows. Consol Glass unveiled their pop-up shop at our St John’s event and this will be an ongoing feature at all future shows.” And if you want KAMERS all year round, check out the KAMERS Online Marketplace, an award-winning selection of some of the favourite Makers at shop.kamersvol.com.

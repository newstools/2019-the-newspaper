The FIA World Rallycross Championship touched down in Riga recently for its penultimate round of the 2019 season – the last on European soil – and another installment of the relentless battle for the championship honours. Monster Energy RX Cartel’s Andreas Bakkerud entered the Championship with a two point lead over year-long rival Timmy Hansen. And following an action packed two-days of racing; which saw the Norwegian take the top qualifier spot, a semi-final win, and a third-place podium, Bakkerud still only has a point separating him from his Swedish rival. Despite this point being in Hansen’s favour – with the Swede having taken the overall win in the Championship final by just a couple of seconds – the two drivers are so closely matched in performance that a truly edge-of-the-seat finale now awaits in Cape Town on 9 – 10 November 2019. “One thing is for sure though – we are going to be ready for a fight in South Africa… bring it on!” – Andreas Bakkerud Team mate and fellow Monster Energy RX Cartel driver Liam Doran finished 6th in the Latvian event’s final. Just after the podium, Andreas said: “It’s been a super tense weekend here in Riga, Coming here with just two points between myself and Timmy, and now leaving with an even smaller margin between us shows how stable both of us are competing at the top of the field. It’s difficult to think about Cape Town right now, because we have to process what we have achieved this weekend, under constantly changing conditions. One thing is for sure though – we are going to be ready for a fight in South Africa… bring it on!”

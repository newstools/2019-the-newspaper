On Friday the 11th of October ILoveBoobies, the breast cancer prevention charity, will be celebrating National ILoveBoobies Day. Through their campaign, which inspires people to give a little and help a lot, they aim to raise funds to conduct breast cancer screenings in rural and impoverished areas. Every R250 raised pays for the screening of a woman, who would otherwise not have access to one, and in turns aids in the bid to save lives through the early detection of cancer. “ILoveBoobies, its brand ambassadors and contributors do more and give more to those less fortunate” explained a charity spokesperson Nicky Webb. “Everyone has been touched by cancer in some way, we want to be able to make a difference by early detection and we do this by creating awareness, education, fund raising and participation in events all over the world. ILoveBoobies serves communities that face social, physical and economic barriers that restrict them from healthcare. We believe that everyone has a right to healthcare and early detection examinations.” “This Friday ILoveBoobies would like to ask people to wear their ILoveBoobies socks to work, dress in a little pink, and spread the vibe, with the spirit of #earlydetectioncansavelives and #givealittlehelpalot” Webb elaborated. “We would like to ask companies and individuals to support our fundraising efforts by purchasing ILoveBoobies apparel or donating via the givengain fundraising portal.” Get involved by joining an ILoveBoobies event on Friday. Rustenberg Girls Primary School, in Rondebosch, will be dressing in pink and selling ILoveBoobies socks at the school. Ride-In Café, Stellenbosch, are hosting a run/walk and ride at 08h00. Tickets are R80 and include a goody bag, coffee and a muffin. Alternatively catch up with the ILoveBoobies team at the Cape Wine Marathon registration, at Meerendal Wine Estate, this weekend. Would-be supporters can purchase ILoveBoobies socks at the marathon expo all weekend. Team PeAk, meanwhile, have taken their fundraising to the road and are riding from Johannesburg to Durban. They have already raised R10 000 towards cancer screenings. For those interested in supporting the charity on an on-going basis there are weekly Sunday runs, from the V&A Waterfront and the Willowbridge shopping centre, which start at 07h00.

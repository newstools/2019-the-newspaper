In the community they follow a precise skills development programme. The foundation of a student’s training commences with Assistant Chef Level 2, which is followed by Professional Cookery level 4 and may even lead to a learnership at a company or hotel. G&D Training uses their partnerships with hotels and companies to link community members to learnership and career development opportunities. Passionate students who wish to further their studies can enrol in the QCTO Occupational Chef level 5 Diploma. Learnerships G&D Training aims to give students a new perspective through learnerships, by preparing them for the realities of the hospitality industry. Students receive in-house practical training accompanied with strong theoretical knowledge in their field of study. Learnerships therefore not only enhance students’ skill levels, but also effectively prepares them for the workplace and accompanying challenges. They are therefore making a significant difference within work environments by successfully developing staff members’ skills. <img class=" wp-image-17669 alignright" src="http://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TNP1019_web36.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="209" srcset="http://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TNP1019_web36.jpg 745w, http://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TNP1019_web36-696x451.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /> The learnerships presented by G&D Training additionally affords a wonderful advancement opportunity for many people starting out in the fields of tourism and hospitality and has thus far been privileged to offer learnerships at the Mount Nelson Hotel, Vineyard Hotel, Feedem and most recently the Double Tree by Hilton Hotel.

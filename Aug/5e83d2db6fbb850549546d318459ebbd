The splendour of Benguela Cove runs deeper than its obvious appeal being perched amongst the natural enchantment of the Bot River Lagoon, vistas of the Atlantic Ocean, stretches of fynbos and towering mountains. Benguela Cove Lagoon Wine Estate boasts South Africa’s longest stretch of ocean facing vineyards – at the lowest altitude of only 3m above sea level. This results in our estate’s award-winning, unique cool climate wines. August is all about women and Benguela Cove is looking forward to create a special and memorable experience for every lady visiting the estate this month. Whilst the vineyards are still in their winter dormancy, the tasting room, restaurant and surrounds remain a hive of activity, leading into Spring when the vines pushes out the first green leaves in September. To rejuvenate your winter body, they are hosting a Women’s Day Vineyard Walk. This fun 5km vineyard walk is complete with the offering of delicious wine, food and entertainment for the whole family. Enjoy four wine tastings on route while you can explore the estate in all its glory. And yes, all woofs are welcome on a leash. What to expect The first stop is located at the crossing of their south facing vineyards and olive groves. This is where the Benguela Cove Lighthouse Collection Sauvignon Blanc grapes are grown – the perfect location to taste that very wine. Here you may also sample the Benguela Cove Estate olive oil and fresh baked bread. The second tasting will be at the southernmost tip of the estate. Whilst enjoying panoramic ocean views, guests can enjoy a tasting of the Benguela Cove Lighthouse Collection Dry Rosé 2018. The third stop leads guests right between the vines and the sea to sample the Benguela Cove Lighthouse Collection Syrah 2017. The Benguela Cove Women’s Day Vineyard Walk concludes back at The Tasting Room, where guests can enjoy the final tasting of the day and toast Women’s Day with their Benguela Cove Cuvee 58 Method Cap Classique.

The African continent is positioning itself as a global style icon, fusing the influences of international trend-makers with the unique colour and vibrancy that characterises its people and cultures. The impact of this colourful continent on the 2019 lifestyle trends will be brought home through the features and products showcasing at Africa’s biggest décor and design exhibition – Decorex SA. Consisting of Decorex Durban, Decorex Cape Town and Decorex Joburg, this year’s much-anticipated theme ‘Designing for Africa – feels like home’ encapsulates the re-birth of the African style powerhouse. “We are at a crucial moment in the evolution of technology, both globally and here at home,” explained Anita Bloom, Creative Director at Decorex SA. “The incredible advances in artificial intelligence, virtual augmented realities and 3D printing are about to transform every aspect of our lives. In response to the imminent digital revolution we are re-focusing on what it means to be human, and this is taking us back to our African roots. Consumers are at a crossroads asking profound questions about their place in the world. How do we hold onto our identity? How do we stay emotionally aware? How do we re-connect with the world around us? By creating a calm, home-style space that gives our minds the freedom to wonder. A space to embrace a positive, new approach to life.” Decorex Cape Town takes place from 1-5 May 2019 in the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Read more articles

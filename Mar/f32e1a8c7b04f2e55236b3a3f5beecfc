One of the top 5 beauty trends in the world, is anti-pollution skincare products. Is this only a fad or should you be concerned about the effect of pollution on your skin? Surely as a South African,  you don’t have to be too worried about air pollution? Especially living in the Western Cape… According to the WHO (World Health Organization), 1 out of 10 people dies yearly from pollution. In South Africa, 7.4% of deaths are caused by pollution. That is about 21,000 South Africans. The World Health Organization defines air pollution as “contamination of both indoor and outdoor environments by any chemical, physical, or biological agent.” You may think to stay away from the smog, and dirty exhaust fumes safeguard you, but it doesn’t. Why Your Skin Needs Protection Against Air Pollution It’s not always what you can see that kills or damages your skin. The culprit, PM 2.5, is 40 times smaller than a grain of sand. PM stands for particulate matter and 2.5 is the size of the particle. As the largest organ in your body, your skin is daily exposed to PM 2.5 in the environment—indoors (fires, cooking, smoking) and outdoors (on sunny and cloudy days). The main function of the skin is to be the barrier that protects the body from harmful environmental elements like viruses, bacteria, sunlight, allergens and particular matter. There are four ways the skin barrier can be penetrated and cause you harm: · Scrapes, scratches, and cuts (mechanical) · Moving through hair follicles (trans-follicular)  · Moving through skin cells (trans-cellular) · Moving in between the spaces of the skin cells (intracellular) Hair follicles cover 10% of the skin area that is exposed to the environment. The follicles are large enough for particulate matter to enter the body. The moment your skin detects this foreign matter, the skin’s immune system reacts to isolate and remove the danger. This process causes inflammation and leads to various skin issues and diseases: · Acne · Age Spots · Eczema · Psoriasis · Skin Ageing · Skin Cancer Is it possible to contain and prevent the damage caused by PM and other air pollution substances?  Yes, it is. How? Help your skin do its job by protecting your skin so it can protect your body.

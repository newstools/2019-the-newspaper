Stellenbosch will host the first IMPI
Challenge of 2019, the IMPI Challenge #1 at Coetzenburg on Saturday, 6 April
2019. “We are excited to kick off the 2019
IMPI Challenge Season in Stellenbosch,” says Pieter du Plessis, IMPI Challenge
Race Director. “IMPI Warriors can look forward to spectacular trail running
combined with adrenaline pumping obstacles that will require crawling,
swinging, climbing, jumping – just about everything fun.  As a venue, Coetzenburg tends to throw its
own curveballs. It’s not the IMPI Challenge if you’re not challenged at some
point.  We invite all adventure seekers
to step outside of their comfort zones and take on the IMPI Challenge #1.  This event is perfect for families, friends
and even corporates.” IMPI Warrior, Armin Botha
(Potchefstroom) made his IMPI Challenge debut at the IMPI Challenge #1
(Stellenbosch) in 2018. “I knew that I’d be going up against the top okes, and
was just hoping to podium. The obstacles were hard especially the brick carry,
while the scenery was beautiful.  I was
blessed with the win.” The women’s race was won by Dominique
D’Oliveira (Bellville). “The route was tough. I took it in my stride. I was
just grateful to finish, winning was a bonus. 
I really enjoyed the obstacles.” There are four categories to choose from when entering the IMPI Challenge: IMPI Mini:  1km with 8 smaller supervised obstacles (ages 6 – 10 years), IMPI Dash: 5km with 11 obstacles (ages 10+, all adults welcome), IMPI Challenge: 10km with 18 obstacles (age 18+ years),and IMPI Corporate: the 10km Challenge distance with extra benefits (age 16+ years). Entrants are encouraged to let

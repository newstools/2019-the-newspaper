After 15 years of using trained observers (spotters) to successfully reduce the risk of shark bites in Cape Town, the Shark Spotters programme is launching a new research project aimed at creating an automated shark spotting system that will enhance their pioneering sustainable shark safety service. The Shark Spotters, the Institute for
Communities and Wildlife in Africa at the University of Cape Town, and
PatternLab SaRL, a research and development company specialising in data
science and computer-aided vision from Switzerland, have launched a project
aimed at developing a low-cost computer-aided vision automatic shark detection
algorithm to be used on fixed cameras above Cape Townâ€™s beaches. The Shark Spotters programme, funded by
the City of Cape Town and the Save Our Seas Foundation, has significantly
improved water user safety at its operating beaches in Cape Town, recording
over 2 500 shark sightings since its inception in 2004. The development of the automated shark
spotting system will build upon this strong foundation and help to overcome
some of the limitations the programme currently experiences including the need
for natural elevation (mountains) and the potential for human fatigue and
error. Field work for the project has begun on
Fish Hoek beach and involves collecting footage of sharks for analysis and development
of the cutting-edge detection algorithm software. While footage of live sharks
is collected where possible, a decoy shark is also being used due to the
sporadic and unreliable nature of shark sightings. Environmental and
experimental variables are recorded during the data collection in order to
assess their impact on the ability of the software to detect sharks, and to
compare results to the effectiveness of the current human-based spotting system
in place. The automated system will not replace the spotters employed in Cape
Town, but rather assist them with more reliable and accurate shark detection. The research project will run for a
total of 18 months after which it is anticipated an effective automated shark
spotting system will have been developed for use in Cape Town and beyond.

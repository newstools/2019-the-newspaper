“We would like to thank our loyal customers for their continued support and patience during the upgrade project. Months of planning have come to fruition as the revamp nears completion. The revamp is aimed at enhancing the overall Willowbridge Shopping Centre experience with the addition of a modern roof structure which will provide additional shelter during winter months. The design by KMH Architects, incorporates elements which will allow ample natural light to seep through, maintaining the much-loved open-air feeling. The project also includes a new Entrance Ramp into P1 Parking Level directly below @Home, which provides easier access and allow us to provide additional parking on Ground Level outside Woolworths. The new Regus office installation of 560m2 additional office space, will also be completed during the 1st quarter of 2019 and will have no impact on activities at the Centre. It is with great excitement that we invite shoppers to a brand-new look on Saturday 16 March 2019 from 10h00 – 15h00. Shoppers are invited to enjoy the ultimate Willowbridge lifestyle experience with complimentary entertainment for children by Bazinga Events, exciting performances by Jacqueline Tolken Music and The Boxer The Ring, Las Paletas artisan lollies and loads of amazing giveaways including R 10 000 in Gift Cards.” Read more articles

With the festive season knocking on our doors, it’s all about home entertaining, creative snacks and indulgent treats. The Vadas bakery has you covered with breads, sweet pies and pastries. Christmas just cannot be without mince pies, absolutely no way! These small sweet pies, filled with delicious homemade mincemeat are as traditional as the day itself. Christmas mincemeat is not, as the name suggests, meat (although it once was). The mincemeat we know today is made entirely from fruits, sugar and alcohol encased in a golden, crunchy but soft crust. These deep and crumbly mince pies are so simple yet delicious and available for the month of December at only R10 each or buy 5 and get 1 free. Treat your guests at home with the now famous Vadas Pastéis de Nata. These golden cups of perfectly crunchy and flaky pastry enrobe a creamy decadence of custard, lightly caramelised and sprinkled with cinnamon. Available at R25 each. The bakery’s treasure trove of ‘Sweet Surrender Pies’, American-style sweet pies such as lemon meringue pie, salted caramel pie, chocolate cream pie and pecan pie (to name a few) are also on offer at R400 per pie. For all your Christmas spreads and dips, be sure to pick up a sourdough or farm loaf bread, baked fresh every day. Pre-order any of the Vadas mince pies, Pastéis de Nata, sweet pies or breads and don’t miss out!  Cooking, planning and preparing a Christmas meal at home could defeat the whole purpose of it being called a holiday. If you’re looking for a relaxed spot to enjoy your day, why not spend your Christmas in the winelands? Bring the family and enjoy a festive lunch along Spier Wine Farm’s spacious lawns at Vadas Smokehouse & Bakery in Stellenbosch. 
The Christmas lunch menu is also available on the evening of the 24th for Christmas eve dinner. A vegetarian menu is also on offer for both days. Book ahead to secure your spot.

Cape Town City Ballet presents a sumptuous production of A Christmas Carol – The Story Of Scrooge that’s perfect holiday entertainment for the whole family! This special Dickens treat for all ages, is a timeless classic story of the triumph of joy and the human spirit over greed. An enchanting dance delight, A Christmas Carol – The Story Of Scrooge has been restaged by South African dance doyenne Veronica Paeper and features lighting design by Wilhem Disbergen. The production was created in 1982 and has not been seen for over 20 years.
On Christmas Eve the elderly and unpleasant old man Ebenezer Scrooge is paid a visit by the Ghost of his dead business partner Joseph Marley who tells him that three Spirits will call on Scrooge: The Spirit of Christmas Past, The Spirit of Christmas Present and the Spirit of Christmas Future. Marley tells Scrooge that unless he listens well and changes his miserly ways he will be forever condemned to be in chains of damnation. This is the story of that night. Ebenezer Scrooge will be played by the highly-regarded actor Marcel Meyer.
“We are excited to be presenting this visual feast of a production that will captivate young and old alike,” says Debbie Turner, CEO of Cape Town City Ballet. A Christmas Carol – The Story Of Scrooge will be presented at Artscape Theatre from 14 to 24 December 2019. Tickets cost R150 to R295.
